All HTML builders are available through Kotlin Extensions with with function literals with receiver, allowing **nested method** idiom, e.g. `body { div { p { text("Hello") } } }`

All HTML builders can also be used in Kotlin in **method chaining** idiom without the need of parenthesis, e.g. `body.div.p.text("Hello).l.l.l`.
The `l` builder emits the end tag.
