summary: >
    Solve issues 103 and 104. The former reported a problem 
    when text() is interleaved between attributes, and the latter
    reported a problem to don't remove newlines defined in script
    or text blocks.

* Solved Issue 103 - We cannot use `.text()` interleaved with attributes and now whenever you do it HtmlFlow will throw an exception.

* Solved Issue 104 - Disabling indentation incorrectly removed newlines inside text and script blocks.

* Improved documentation with examples of data binding, if/else, and loops usage.

* Turn `HtmlView` strongly typed with the type `M` of the model.
