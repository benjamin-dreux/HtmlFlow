* Kotlin Extensions - new `dyn { }` lambda with parent Element as receiver to allow the use of implicit `this`.

* New extensions on factory methods `view()` and `viewAsync()` to discard parameter `page` and allow start building on implicit this.

* Upgrade to HtmlApiFaster 1.0.16 with new `raw()` to distinguish from `text()`. While the text visitor should escape HTML the raw should keep text as it is.
